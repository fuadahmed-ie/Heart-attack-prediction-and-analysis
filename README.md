# Project Name: Heart attack prediction and analysis

## Introduction

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early prediction of heart attacks can save countless lives. This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart attacks using various machine learning algorithms. By analyzing features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, we aim to develop accurate predictive models to aid in early diagnosis and preventive measures.
